# F.A.C.T
Fashion, Aesthetics, Creativity, Technology

Inspiration
- The idea for F.A.C.T came from a common frustration—liking a pattern/color in theory but realizing it doesn’t suit you once you wear it. Many people buy or create clothing based on a design they loved at first glance, only to feel disappointed when they actually put it on. This led to a bigger question: Why can’t we “try before we commit” when it comes to fabric patterns?

What it does
- We wanted to build a website that allows people to experiment with different designs without regretting making the wrong choice. We understand the struggle to visualize patterns before buying or sewing. The Website allows user to try on different items and even generate a catalog of clothing to try on at their leisure. The viewing portal automatically fits clothing to your body with the ability to swap within a simple gesture. 
How we built it
Our website was built using Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, openCV, Pillow, socketIo, BeautifulSoup, mediapip, flask, and numpy.

Challenges we ran into and What we learned
- The main challenge with this project was that Developing F.A.C.T. required balancing customization with simplicity, ensuring users could experiment freely without feeling overwhelmed. The camera try-on feature needed realistic adjustments in positioning and scaling. Additionally, creating an intuitive interface for swapping fabric patterns, adjusting tile ranges, and navigating the camera was a challenge. We attempted to integrate the resizing of fabric pattern PDFs and projector files for the user to customize their sewing patterns to be a tailored fit every time. While the code was working for resizing, we were unable to flesh out the feature thoroughly and were struggling with accurate adjustments thus, it is not seen in our final product.

What's next for F.A.C.T. - Fashion, Aesthetics, Creativity, and Technology
- F.A.C.T hopes to become an interface utilized by sewers. The technology would allow them to test out the fabric pattern before continuing with sewing. We hoped to integrate a feature to allow the user to resize a sewing pattern database automatically based on their measurements; however, despite our efforts, this was not achievable within the timeframe. With the growing trend of using mobile apps for fashion, it might be worth exploring how the platform could evolve into a mobile app.
